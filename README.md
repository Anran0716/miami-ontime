# Analysis of Miami-dade Transit buses’ On-time Performance
 
 This project conducted an analysis of Miami-Dade Transit’s on-time performance using GTFS static data as well as data acquired from the [Swiftly API](https://github.com/Anran0716/miami-ontime/assets/85720119/46cd392a-0608-4363-b28e-2e7dfc69968c) from October 2022 to March 2023. Then predict the bus delay time based on advanced machine learning models. 

`Visualization.ipynb`:  We applied two measurements for analyzing the on-time performance of transit vehicles: arrival time differencee and headway difference. 

`service time & bus number passing by a stop.ipynb`: We computed the daily service time for each route and the daily number of transit vehicles serving each transit stop to understand the transit service supply.

`Project_Report.pdf`: This study predicted the bus on-time performance based on several machine learning models, including **decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, and XGBoost**.
